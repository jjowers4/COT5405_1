Instruction to Compile on Linux:

1. To Download GCC Compiler, type the following into terminal
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install g++
3. Navigate to the location of "Complexity.cpp"
4. Type "g++ -std=c++11 complexity.cpp"
5. Type "./a.out", hit enter
6. The program should run in the terminal window. It may take 5-10 min for the entire program to print out

***NOTE: When I compiled the program, I was using Visual Studio on Windows 10. I noticed a difference in the time when using windows vs linux in the data. The data set in the powerpoint slides is the data set given when on a windows platform.
